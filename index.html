    <p/> Before we begin, you must know what to eat with sushi. I usually start my meal with miso soup and possibly some tempura—fried vegetables in a crunchy batter.
With your sushi, you will probably get wasabi (green paste made from Japanese horseradish) and ginger (pink pickled slices).
The Japanese use ginger to clear their palettes between courses. The wasabi should be mixed with shoyu (soy sauce) as a dipping sauce for your sushi.
The sushi roll you get might have brightly colored orange spheres or tiny black spheres on it — these are both roe, which are fish eggs.
Tobiko is the roe of flying fish and is usually a bright orange, though it can be colored to be black or even green 
Masago is the roe of capelin — this is also usually orange-colored unless it is dyed</p>
