<p/>"Sushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known today as nare-zushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司,) - salted fish, stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from spoiling;[1] the rice would be discarded for consumption.[2] This early type of sushi became an important source of protein for its Japanese consumers. The term sushi comes from an antiquated grammatical form no longer used in other contexts, and literally means "sour-tasting"; the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste.[3] Narezushi is still made in Japan to this day."</p>
